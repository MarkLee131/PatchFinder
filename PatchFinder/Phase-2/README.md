# Phase 2: Fine-tuning CodeReviewer for re-ranking commits

This Folder contains the fine-tuning code for the CodeReviewer model to re-rank the commits. For convenience, we also reuse the code for ablation study and comparison with baselines.

## 1. Data Preparation

Phase-2 uses the output of Phase-1 as the input data, i.e., the top-100 commits (retrieved by our Hybrid Retriever) for each CVE.

Since the fine-tuned model files are large, we have not included them in the repository. However, you can download the fine-tuned model files from [Google Drive]( https://drive.google.com/file/d/1s7pgHduaXoumEx_stb32S75Ysj39U0bd/view?usp=sharing).
